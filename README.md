# Stardew-Valley-Fishing-Bot
*A python 3.6 program for a fully autonomous fishing bot. Work in progress.*

It heavily depends Opencv to understand what is going on in your screen, doing template matching and color detection to individually track the little green rectangle and the little fish icon. I am not a experienced programmer, so don't expect a lot from this. The sole purpose of me posting this in GitHub is so someone can help me.

## How to help with data collecting:

To colaborate collecting data for the future neural network, you just need download **save_data.py** and play the game with it on the background, then upload the _frames.npy_ and _training_data.npy_ to this GitHub or send to me at _ansetti7@gmail.com_. As I am still learning how to do all of this, I am probably doing something wrong, so it will take a while.
