I will write this sometime. Visit Out GitHub, there is a nice README file over there!<br>Add that cool wikipedia image about fishing on the background of this.</p>

        <h2>Why I made it</h2>
        <p>I wanted some challenge to do as I wait for my university results (I am trying to enter University of SÃ£o Paulo - Aeronautical Engineering) and this seemed cool, as I have played a lot of Stardew Valley this vacation and the fishing mini-game is simple, because you only have one button to click. </p>

        <h2>Help me</h2>
        <p>I am a single programmer and there is still a lot to do, so if you want to help out let me know. However, don't solve the issues not marked as "help wanted" at GitHub, because I'm a beginner and I'm trying to learn it myself. Commented code that explains itself and recommendations are always welcome no matter the case.</p>
